Furniture Design Desktop Application
# Introduction

In the evolving landscape of furniture design, the integration of technology with interior design is revolutionizing client engagement and satisfaction. Our desktop application aims to bridge the gap between customers and in-store designers, enhancing the customer experience and facilitating the communication process. Targeting both designers and consumers, our application allows users to visualize furniture within their rooms and enables designers to create and present personalized designs.

# Background
This initiative was born out of the need to improve client experiences and expedite the design process in the furniture industry. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, we provide a platform for customers to visualize and customize furniture designs in their living spaces, thereby aligning customer preferences with design implementations seamlessly.

# Features
2D and 3D Visualization: Users can view furniture designs in both 2D and 3D, providing a comprehensive understanding of how each piece fits within their space.
Room Customization: Tailor room dimensions and aesthetics to match real-life scenarios, enhancing the realism of designs.
Design Management: Robust features for creating, scaling, adjusting, and customizing designs ensure a seamless design process.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Developed using Java Swing and computer graphics libraries, ensuring consistent user experiences across multiple platforms.
Gathering Data
Our approach included interviews, observational studies, competitor analysis, and prototype testing to ensure a deep understanding of user needs and market demands. This iterative process allowed us to refine our application continuously based on real-world feedback and insights.

# Design Process
Starting with low-fidelity prototypes to gather initial feedback, we progressed to high-fidelity prototypes designed in Figma, focusing on usability, visual clarity, and simplicity. Our design principles prioritize an intuitive and engaging user interface.

# Evaluation
Despite the challenges in accurately rendering 3D models, our application excels in 2D visualization and design functionalities. Ongoing evaluations and updates are key to our strategy, aiming to enhance the application's features based on user feedback and technical assessments.

# Implementation
Targeting homeowners, interior designers, and office managers, our application features a wide range of furniture options, customizable designs, and an intuitive UI/UX designed in Figma, implemented in Java and Java Swing. We focus on creating a user-friendly environment that encourages creativity and personalization.
